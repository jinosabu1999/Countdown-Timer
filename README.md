# Countdown Timer

A simple Countdown Timer web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The timer allows users to set a countdown from a specified time and plays an alarm sound when the countdown ends.


## Features

- Click on the "Start" button to begin the countdown.
- When the timer reaches zero, an alarm sound will play, and the message "Time is up!" will be displayed.
- Click on the "Stop" button to stop the alarm and reset the timer.

## Getting Started
